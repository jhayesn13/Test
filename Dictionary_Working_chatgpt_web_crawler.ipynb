            "70% of medical decisions depend on laboratory test results performed by clinical laboratory scientists. -CDC The clinical laboratory sciences program is an accredited undergraduate degree achieving a Bachelor of Sciences that leads to national board certification, from the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP), and NYS licensure. Medical Laboratory Scientists (MLS), also known as Clinical Laboratory Technologists, are nationally certified healthcare professionals who aid in the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. An undergraduate degree in clinical laboratory sciences involves an extensive theoretical and experiential knowledge base through clinical internships at affiliated hospitals and reference laboratories. The Clinical Laboratory Sciences program within the College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences is committed to a student-centered inclusive pedagogical model that supports student success, personal, and professional development. Our graduates are equipped with the tools to become leaders in their respective fields who work effectively in interprofessional collaborative environments. Students perform laboratory procedures that support the development of critical independent judgment: The Clinical Laboratory Sciences program at St. John’s University strives to prepare our students with the highest quality education, technical abilities, and professional attitudes necessary to be integral members of the healthcare team as clinical laboratory scientists. Students will acquire skills to practice as ethical and competent professionals, maintain the strictest confidence in patient matters and recognize their responsibility for the betterment of human welfare. Contact the Program Director to answer any questions regarding the Clinical Laboratory Sciences program.

Our experienced faculty in the clinical laboratory is here to help you. The clinical laboratory sciences program holds accreditation through the National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Sciences (NAACLS), 5600 N. River Rd., Suite 720, Rosemont, IL 60018. The most recent accreditation visit extended accreditation until 2027. Graduates of the clinical laboratory sciences program receive a Bachelor of Science degree and are eligible to sit for the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP) national certification exam. This certification is recognized across the country and enables graduates to practice in any state. Successful completion of the courses leading to the Bachelor of Science in Clinical Laboratory Sciences and passing the ASCP national certification exam allow graduates to apply to the New York State Department of Education for a license to practice as a clinical laboratory technologist. In addition, graduates who go on to practice in other states with licensure laws are eligible to apply for that state’s license, based on passing the certification exam. Professional licensure and certification requirements often vary from state to state. St. John’s University has not determined requirements for individual states beyond New York. If you reside or plan to reside outside New York you are strongly encouraged to contact the appropriate state licensing agency in that state to seek information and guidance before beginning the program. To earn the Bachelor of Science degree in Clinical Laboratory Sciences, students complete 138 credits, including core, major-sequence and elective requirements, as outlined below. For more information about courses, please see the College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences section of our Undergraduate Bulletin.
