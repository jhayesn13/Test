campuses in rome italy and paris france drawing judges and scholars from around the world our programs promote an important open dialogue on the relationship between religion and the state and the role of law in various religious traditions welcome to the mattone center for law and religion at st johns law these are exciting times for people who study law and religion as two of the most important institutions in society law and religion have always been linked law traditionally has looked to religion for fundamental concepts like justice and equality and religion often has made law central to believers daily lives for centuries constitutional government has tried to accommodate religion in a system of ordered liberty maintaining the separation of church and state while respecting the deepest commitments of many citizens while the nexus between law and religion is familiar to law students and lawyers the relationship is raising new and urgent issues today religious commitments remain vitally important for millions of people everywhere and as a result of globalization people of different faiths and no faith are encountering each other more and more frequently not only in settings like intergovernmental organizations and humanrights tribunals but in local communities as well  in schools city halls courthouses and neighborhoods throughout the world thus it is now essential for law students and lawyers  and citizens generally  to understand more about the complicated ways in which law and religion relate to one another to that end we have established the center for law and religion the center sponsors academic programs in the united states and abroad sincerely marc o degirolami mark l movsesian this innovative biennial seminar gives selected st johns
